Watching how to work with assembler in MacOs
======
Notes:
Once upon a time, I was fond of x86 assembler. I programmed under Windows OS _(used WIn32 api)_ using MASM and TASM compilers. In this
project, I look at the features of assembly language programming for MacOs using the NASM compiler. It's all just for
the fun of it.

Projects:

- triangle - simple console output (my version hello world)
- mean - simple arithmetic mean
